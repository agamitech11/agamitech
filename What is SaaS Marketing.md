What is SaaS Marketing?
SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) marketing is the process of promoting cloud-based software solutions to attract, convert, and retain customers. Unlike traditional software that requires a one-time purchase, SaaS businesses operate on a subscription model, requiring unique strategies to ensure continuous growth and customer retention.
Key aspects of SaaS marketing include:
Customer Acquisition – Bringing in new users through SEO, paid ads, and content marketing.
Customer Retention – Keeping customers engaged to reduce churn.
Expansion Revenue – Upselling and cross-selling additional features to existing users.
Why SaaS Marketing is Different
SaaS marketing differs from traditional product marketing due to:
Longer Sales Cycles – Customers often require multiple touchpoints before making a purchase.
Emphasis on Retention – SaaS relies on recurring revenue, making customer success critical.
Product-Led Growth (PLG) – Many SaaS companies leverage free trials or freemium models.
